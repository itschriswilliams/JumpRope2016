                    JumpRope was founded by teachers who are passionate about standards-based grading.
                </h3>
                <h4 class=" ltgrey-text">
                    Determined to engage students with active pedagogy, purposeful planning and authentic learning experiences, Jesse Olsen began creating custom software tools for his New York City classroom. He built a team of seasoned teachers and engineers to create a gradebook steeped in authentic assessment principles. After helping districts across the country transform their teacher practice, JumpRope is now the premier partner for successful standards-based grading implementation.

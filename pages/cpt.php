                <p class="white-text">For administrators, the Curriculum Planning Tool can help develop your district’s standards around state standards or the common core. You can provide these standards to your teachers so they can use them as the starting place for their curriculum planning. This will pave the path to your standards-based grading philosophy. </p>

                    <p class="white-text">Once the curriculum has been created teachers can easily import lessons and assessments into the gradebook to be scored. This saves teachers the frustration of having to do "double work."</p>

                    <p class="white-text">District curriculum teams can collaborate with teachers in development of the curriculum maps. When comparing the curriculum maps against the gradebook, curriculum staff can see what's actually being taught and are able to easily keep the curriculum up to date.</p>

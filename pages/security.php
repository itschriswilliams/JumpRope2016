                            <h2>Physical Security</h2>
                            <p>Your JumpRope data is hosted on Amazon Web Services, which operates one of the largest data centers in the world. <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/security/">Straight from Amazon</a>: Amazon has many years of experience in designing, constructing, and operating large-scale data centers. AWS infrastructure is housed in Amazon-controlled data centers throughout the world. Only those within Amazon who have a legitimate business need to have such information know the actual location of these data centers, and the data centers themselves are secured with a variety of physical controls to prevent unauthorized access. <strong>Armed guards outside of the data center, and employees have restricted access.</strong></p>

                        <li>
                            <h2>Encrypted Login & Data Access</h2>
                            <p>Customer and student data for all accounts can only be accessed via secure protocols such as HTTPS and SSH, and is verified through DigiCert. All passwords are encrypted on our servers and databases and are never sent to JumpRope servers in plain text. We run a dedicated environment behind firewalls with constant internal and external monitoring so that nobody can access student data without first securely logging in. All software is updated regularly to ensure the latest security patches.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h2>Secure Employee Policies</h2>
                            <p>Even the best security can be compromised without proper policies. At JumpRope, only a select few have direct or remote access to the servers where data is stored. We go to great lengths to ensure the right balance between support and a secure infrastructure. Employees can only access accounts when explicitly providing support for or with perrmission from an account owner or administrator.</p>

                            <h2>Data Protection, Reliability, &amp; Redundancy</h2>
                            <p>We know how important access to student data is to your work in the school. In addition to protecting your data from unauthorized access, JumpRope goes to great lengths to ensure that your data will not be lost and can always be accessed. We take several steps to guard your data against computer crashes, network problems, and even natural disasters. All data is written synchronously to multiple physical locations (running on different power grids) before we tell you that it is saved, and incremental backups are taken and stored in a third location every five minutes. On this infrastructure, we've never lost a bit of student data and we boast industry-leading availability. Contact us for more information on our security, redundancy, and availability.</p>
